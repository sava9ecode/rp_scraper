# Simple web-scrapper

This is a script for fetching job postings from the Internet. With it I learned  
how to scrape data from the Web using Python, requests, and Beautiful Soup.

Tools and stack: #python #requests #BeautifulSoup

## Quick start

- Create project dir
- Create and activate venv
- Follow the commands below:

```
git clone git@github.com:sava9ecode/rp_scraper.git
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

That's it! Enjoy your journey.
